KubeCamp means Kubernetes Bootcamp!

We believe in the business and personal-development value of a well-organized, instructor-led, hands-on bootcamp, especially with a complex system like Kubernetes. This is why we created KubeCamp, a 2-days, on-site workshop-like bootcamp.

Ideal audience is power developers and administrators. The first day is oriented more towards beginners to Kubernetes in order to help you build a good foundation of understanding, and the second day covers more advanced topics mostly on administration.
