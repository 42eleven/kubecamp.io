Ioannis Dritsas, aka dreamPathsProjekt, since discovering the world wide web, drew the parallels between the ancient "Aboriginal routes of dreams" (Dream Paths) and the digital connected world of abstract thought and collective soul that was the early web.

Started his early career as a web back-end software engineer, before discovering Docker, Kubernetes and the world of containers in 2017. Since then he has been involved in multiple roles and positions, ranging from cloud-infrastructure software engineering, to SRE and back.

Currently he is the infrastructure lead of Corsmed AB, slowly but steadily, helping to disrupt the medical imaging simulation field and bring affordable and commoditized early diagnosis to as many people around the world as possible.

His specialization and interests are deeply rooted in Kubernetes and the CNCF landscape, with experience such as self-hosted clusters, scalable enterprise environments, real-life minimal-downtime legacy migrations to K8s, meeting enterprise, compliance standards and requirements, and a weird knack for getting deep in the hard problems of stateful applications, container storage, clusters and distributed databases. Lately his focus is on treating K8s as a potential common language across managing infrastructure resources and the cloud landscape and a promising platform to build, much needed abstractions on top, with the goal to bridge the communication gap between development teams and cluster administrators.
