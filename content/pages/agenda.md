     * Long-term maintenance
   * The tipping point: understanding the threshold of complexity for introducing K8s
     * Technology implications:
       * Traditional cloud architecture vs the platform model.
       * Consistency vs glue.
       * The container orchestration landscape, circa 2023.
     * Social implications:
   * Implications on the existing in-house team
   * Implications on hiring
### 2. Docker images and containers
   * Building images
   * Running containers
   * Mounting volumes & the storage layers
      * Understand process isolation
      * Exposing ports & the overlay “virtual” network
### 3. Orchestration & Control-Plane Basics
   * The Kubernetes architecture
   * How would you architect a solution that solves the web application’s problems?
   * The 3 pillars of K8s design:
     * Namespaces & Isolation
     * The reconciliation loop pattern & controllers. Desired vs Current state.
     * Abstraction & interfaces are everywhere.
   * The anatomy of the control-plane
   * State: ETCD

       * Init
       * Adapter
     * Pod DNA and co-located container attributes.
   * Wtf are all those legos?
     * Deployments & ReplicaSets: A good example of multi-layer abstraction to achieve change management good practices.
